                        The movie basically tells us that simpler things in life
                        is one of the important things in life.
                    <p>It explains about
                        how we are always occupied with the difficulties in life and
                        we are unable to enjoy the simplest things in life .</p>
                    <p> whatever you think is your life purpose dosent really
                        matter if you dont give yorself enough time
                        to enjoy the blessings of life.
